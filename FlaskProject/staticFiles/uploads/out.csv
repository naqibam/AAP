"Rand was a good guy, really... he was. But I felt he had an alter-ego when he left to go home and grade. His expectations and how he picked apart his students papers was simply not fair. Again, great guy but avoid this class with him!!!"
"He is brilliant in his field, but expects his students to perform at high levels, with unrealistic expectations. Only by a miracle did I get an A, and that was after a heavy curve. He does care about his students though, as he gives lots of time in class for work, while he goes around giving tips and answering questions."
He has a major in philosophy which is why all the papers you have to write are based on philosophy. As long as your paper agrees with what he thinks you will get a good grade. Otherwise the class is boring and he talks for an hour about nonsense but it is mandatory to attend otherwise your grade will drop.
"I thought his class was extremely hard but despite it all, I became a confident writer. People on here say 'you can only get a c on a paper' WRONG. I got an A and a B. You just have to be in it to win it. If you want to get an A, get a different teacher. If you want learn, Go for Rand. He made Eng. 110 worth something."
"I recently just finished taking Comp 110 with Rand and it was the hardest class of my freshman semester. He takes it way too serious for a 100 level class. 80% of the class is papers so you would think you control the grade you get, right? Wrong.  He will tear apart your paper and give you a bad grade despite your efforts. I worked hard for a C."
"Steven Rand is a nice person and really interesting to hear him speak. I am always inspired after a lecture. However, never expect to get anything higher than a C. You can think your paper is perfect but, he will tear it apart in seconds. Take a different professor if you don't want to put 9 hours of work into a paper you get an 'average' grade on."
Hard class 
He graded a 100 level class like we were all English majors in a 300 or above level class. Never got higher than a C on a paper. I went to the writing center for every paper. Very unclear in instructions and hard to approach with questions. Don't take the class from him.
Tough grader on papers make sure you do your work and drafts. Participation grades save you in the long run. Dont miss class and do your work. Go to the tutor center helps alot
Do not take English 110 with Rand. I don't feel any better at writing due to his confusing grading style. 
Bottom line Rand needs to retire before he ruins everyone's GPA's.  He thinks he knows so much about English and thinks it is his job to make essay assignments unneeded riddles.  He answers questions with questions and likes to talk trash about high school English teachers; hating on the high school teachers ironically makes it like high school. FR
He will only give your paper a C. It does not matter if it is good or not. Work extremely hard if you plan on passing.
one of the worst professors at UND. Extremely hard grader and expects to much in a 100 level class. Thinks that everyone's papers should be masterpieces. No matter how long i spent on a paper i couldnt get higher than a C. Only reason i got a B in the class was because i never missed a class. 
"This class is so pointless its ridiculous.  I'm in the class currently (only because its required.) The class has no relevance to anything in life.  Rand is a ****, the class is so boring. He could make the class so much better by writing papers that actually have meaning to  them instead of what some philosopher said.  Textbook reading is hard!!  "
Horrible professor. He does not believe in A's.  Thinks that other teachers grade too easily.  Answers your questions with other questions that do not help you.  Teaches you irrelevant material that you will never use again. Worst professor I have ever had.
"Worst professor ever. He asked me personal questions that were uncomfortable, made me feel stupid when I asked questions, and overall discouraged me. Do not take english 125 from him."
"I attend his Business and Technical Writing course. Rand humiliates people for not understanding assignments when they ask. Very egotistical, rude to those who need help, very difficult work, hard grader -even on those who are following directions. I highly recommend waiting to take this class from anyone else. Not worth losing points on your GPA."
"He was a very hard grader, but he graded on improvement throughout the semester, not on how great of a  greater you were (I mean he obviously graded on how good of a writer you were, but it was more on how much you progressed). I learned a lot from him. I am even taking me next english class with him. Definitely take his course if you can!"
"Professor Steven Rand is very unclear and grades very hard. If you are in his English classes, drop if you want something less than a C. He hates that 'students were graded too easy in high school' so in response to that, he likes to fail his students."
"He is terrible! If you have him drop him IMMEDIATELY! He is mean, and an extremely hard grader!!!!"
Awful. Horrible grading.
I wish I could give him a zero
Not good.
"This was a tough class. I expected all college classes to be like this, but since most are not it was somewhat refreshing to have a professor push me this much. If you are willing to put in the work for Mr. Rand you will reep the benefits. If not, then take this class from someone else."
"He is a unruly professor. He grades on how he feels your ideas are. There is never a right answer, papers can ALWAYS use improvement. I would not recommend him to anyone wanting a grade over a C, even to get that you must put in an excessive amount of time into each paper."
"He is confusing in every aspect: in lecture, in assignments and in critiquing. His assignments are mundane and never change.  I expected to explore writing and become better.  He is an impossible grader, espcially because he grades on how HE feels about your ideas, not on grammer or content.  VERY DISAPPOINTING."
"Worst teacher I have had at UND. Sorry I don't have a PhD in English. His grading style is way too rough for a 125 class. nobody in my class has an A. I have put in 3x more hours for this class than any other but still this class is my worst grade. If possible, avoid this teacher!"
worst experience of my life. expects way too much for a 100 level course. take this class if you want to spend 15 hours on a three page paper and still get a C-. ridiculous grading policies.
"For as much of a waste as UNIV 101 is, he did an ok job at keeping things interesting.  Avoid UNIV 101 altogether if you can."
"His expectations are high for a required 100-level class, especially since most who take it aren't English majors. To his credit, he's smart and gives good feedback. I wouldn't recommend him to a freshman."
Steven rand just a joke!! and so incrediablely socially awkward! do not take this class unless you like to fail out of college! He gives you directions for a paper but grades on whatever is on his mind that day his grading makes no sense and no one has ever gotten an A in one of his classes yet.... if you dont believe me he will tell you this.
"I struggled through his class. First- he's a lawyer, so he'll lead you on making you think one thing without actually promising anything.  Second- he'll give you about 20 different instructions on one paper and he'll grade it by how he's feeling. Stupid class, I worked so hard and managed a B but he told me that I had &quot;weak writing.&quot; Avoid him!"
"Hey be nice. Yeah, he's hard to understand, and a very harsh grader, but he's a teacher and at least he's doing his job (of course, everyone including me would love easier, more comprehendable classes) just be greatful he's willing to put up with everyone's bull hoping that he helped at least one student improve in literature."
"Stevevn Rand was the absolute worst professor i have ever had.  He's without a doubt the hardest teacher you can take for any english classes.  He grades extremely hard, and not at the level of a 100 class. Also Steven Rand is the biggest &quot;Creeper&quot; he makes everyone around him feel extremely uncomfortable."
"This is the hardest 100 level class ever. It doesn't matter if you dedicate your life to this class, you still won't get an A! Take it a another semester or with a different professor. His directions are unclear. He goes against everything the book says, but tells you to use the book.  He's confusing, a hard grader, and a different guy. STAY AWAY!!"
"I am currently in this class.  I took this, because I was told it was supposed to be easier than 120.  I regret staying in this class with Rand as my Professor.  He is nice and pretty smart, but his grading is ridiculous.  He is the hardest grader I have ever encountered.DONT take him, if you are taking this class as a general basically. LISTEN."
"I took 125 because I heard it was easier than 120 unless you get a certain professor. Well this is that professor. He's a nice guy but expects perfection and is out of touch with reality. The class is boring and hard, and the book is expensive. First paper was 3-4 pages, last will be 15 with each in between getting larger. Would NOT recommend him."
This was by far the best learning experience I have had at UND. He is a hard grader but he helps by marking your papers with serious suggestions. I feel that many mistake his marks for personal attacks when he is only trying to bring the best out in his students. My writing skills have improved a hundred fold. I would recommend him to anyone.
"I should have read these comments before I took this class. This was by far the worse teacher I have had! He makes you feel dumb and expects way to much for a 100 level class. Worked my butt off to get a B in the course! If you can, please switch to another teacher, you will be thankful you did!! He expects everyone is an English Major!"
I suggest never taking him...i read the comments on here but figured it wouldnt be so bad so stayed in...wrong move...trust me..get out of the class ASAP...his instructions were never clear and he made you write the paper then changed his assignment my advice for the writers group is to just write a bunch of crap because you'll rewrite it anyway

"horrible teacher, i had to transfer out of state i hated this guy so much"
He was a very unfair teacher... i suggest NOT taking him!
IMPOSSILE!  If it is still possible to drop this class... DO IT!!  It is not possible to get above a C.  And to just get a C you have to work your butt off!
"I think he is a great guy to just talk about music, and fun stuff outside of school, but he never answers questions you have, and gives like a couple B's in the class the rest...  you know..."
what can i say about rand....those of you who hate him so much should be lucky that you didn't have to endure his class five days a week for six weeks for an hour and a half each day....YOU SHOULD FEEL SOMEWHAT LUCKY!
This man is the devil trapped in human form. It is currently 2:42am the day before this final paper and I want to gouge my eyes out. If I could give some advice to future students I would recommend dropping at the soonest possible moment and save yourself some time before drop day or prepare to spend 8 hours writing papers to get a C-.I despise him
Impossible to a get above a C- on anything!!! He treats you like you are an employee of a Rocket science nasa program or something......Nice guy but a lil out of touch with reality
he sucks...and he wants you to fail at life...stay away.. far away...
"It is impossible to get a good grade.  If you get a B, congradulations, i think you're a first. he is an unfair grader.  I went to the writing center when he worked and had him look at my paper, made all the changes he told me to do and still go a C.  I spent way too much time on his papers.  If you have him, get out now!!!!!!"
Never understood what was asking for because he never told you what he really wanted you to do. He's a total ****.
impossible to get a good grade

"hes pretty tough, expects too much"
"He expects a lot from his students, but does take the time to get to know everyone.  I'd suggest going to the writing lab before you ask him for help..and he tends to suggest that too, or else be prepared for a lot of red ink."
this guy is hard as nails.  all he did was whup my ass when I asked for help
He sucks
He Hated me .... never taught us how to write

Rediculous teacher...kills you on stupid details
"The course is difficult, but doable. Mr. Farm will help you, but the key to this course is to use  math learning center. He is a professor that wants to see you pass so he tries to help as much as possible."
"Everyday there is a WebAssign assignment given out (very time consuming and they don't help you on the exams). The three exams he gives are extremely HARD!, all I can say is just practice ... a lot. I got a F on my first exam and had to ace the rest to get an A overall. lastly, the final will wreck you, the girl sitting next to me cried during it."
"Mr. Farm is one of the nicest people you will meet. WebAssign assignments get handed out every day after class to practice problems and a quiz usually appears every day at class. Do a lot of practice questions for the 3 midterm tests. For the final he makes you understand the concepts instead of memorizing problems. Put the work in, get an A."
"Tests are hard because they never matched up with notes and lectures. On the final test, we had to get a 70% on it or we didn't pass the Everything that you think is gonna be on the test, is not. Expect homework 4 days a week. Would not recommend."
"Mr. Farm is the best math teacher I have ever had. He is super funny and very passionate about what he does. There is a quiz almost every day in class, but it is not the end of the world if you miss one."
Take this class with a different prof
He will answer all the questions you have. And he is willing to give his students a second chance to take passed due hw. Random in class quizzes is easy!
Stuart is among the nicest professors I've ever had. Unfortunately this didn't translate into him being an effective one. Prepare for loads of homework and daily quizzes.
"If you take a class with Stuart Farm, be ready to spend A LOT of time outside of class on homework, often times teaching yourself unfortunately. Also, there is a quiz in class pretty much every day, so go! The homework is challenging and time consuming, but the tests are much easier which is nice. He isn't the best at explaining material, but ok."
Terrible teacher all around. Had him my first year in college for math and got stuck with him again my junior year and nothing changed.. he maybe even got worse..
Nice person but absolutely sucks at teaching math. This class is supposed to be for students who are below the average math scores but he makes it so difficult. I'm bad at math to start with and he doesn't help. Avoid him at all costs.
"I took Math 92 and 93 in one semester, it was very fast paced. If you missed any class you would be behind for a while. All in all he was a good teacher, I think a lot of people didn't like moving at that pace and in turn disliked him."
"Took this class for interest, also was the first math course in College. It was very hard to start with, extensive and new HW every class(Webassign), Prepare to do them, with solid understanding. attendence are vital. Test are very based on in class assignments and lecture examples."
"Farm has homework almost nightly, but it nothing that wasn't able to be done quickly for the most part.  His final test accounted for the most percentage of the points in the class so studying is mandatory if you want to pass this class."
"If you don't show your work or show that you double checked your answers he'll give you a zero, even if you got the question right.  Also you can't skip because he does in class practice that you turn in at the end of the class."
Very Nice guy. very willing to help
"Mr. Farm is the nicest man you will ever meet. His concepts are easy to figure out. As long as you pay attention and show up, you will be fine."
Kinda quirky but he's a good guy that cares. Show up everyday for free points. Quizzes almost every week (turned into group quizzes by the end of the semester). Test very similar to quizzes. Homework almost every day and it is much harder than what you will see on the quizzes/test though if you ask for extensions you'll get it every time. Math On!
"Kind of weird, makes corny jokes all the time but one of the better math professors I've had. He's passionate about the subject and it shows. He spends extra time making sure that his students understand the reasons behind why you do certain steps and, for me, it was helpful in my understanding. Recommended."
"This class is  a giant headache. So far, we've had over 30 assignments(only worth 20% of grade) that each take hours to complete, because Stuart puts many problems that we never went over in class . On top of that, we have weekly comprehensive quizzes that are inconsistent in difficulty and points. Simply, I pity anyone who has to take this class."
I would not recommend this professor if you' re not strong in math. You should expect to do homework almost every night. New homework assignment after each class. Doesn't give traditional exams but weekly quizzes for points. Text book assigned was of little help. Homework take hours to complete for only small portion of grade.
"Stuart Farm, so far, has been the worst professor I have had. He grades so harshly that it is almost impossible to get even a C. (At one point I had a 48%) (& Im the average A/B student) He gives weekly quizzes and gives time consuming homework. I would not recommend him."
"He is the worst teacher that I have had for the past ten years. He goes way overboard with trying to explain things, and when he does explain things, it doesn't show up on the test or quizzes. There are many other students in my class that have no idea what is going on. Don't take any of his classes. You have to teach yourself the lessons."
Stuart Farm is a fantastic guy that is very easy to get along with. Greets you with a smile every day and is excited to see you each and every day and tries to make the class fun. Defenitly introduce yourself to him. He is confusing in his explaining of concepts. He tends to over-explain where it gets confusing. He is a very respectable person.
"Stuart Farm is a nice guy and cares about his students, but that doesn't result in effective teaching or keeping the class engaged. He doesn't seem to understand that students taking Math146 are the least likely to raise there hand and contribute, and you can't have a discussion with 100 people. For grades, watch him like a hawk and email him ASAP."
"Mr. Farm is a good teacher, but is not quite clear on the types of questions we need to go over. The homework and in-class assignments are a lot tougher than the actual exams."
"Mr. Farm was a nice guy and tried to make everyone laugh. But points wise I had an A, because of his curve I had a C. He never explained anything and if you asked him a question he never seemed to answer it. I would avoid taking his class, unless you want to fail. "
"Professor Farm is a nice guy and wants you to do well, but he is very confusing. Avoid him if possible. I took Math93 with him, and although it's very simple math, he makes if somehow difficult. I hadn't had math since my junior year of high school, so I had to take this. His explanations make things more difficult. Have to teach yourself. "
"His class was not too bad, but he tries very hard to get the attention of his students by cracking corny jokes. I skipped class most of the time, and did not miss much. "
"Gives easy examples in class when teaching, then when it comes to web assign homework its harder stuff that he never taught, only teaches the basic examples and expects you to take it from there on your own."
"Open a new tab, go on Campus Connection and change to a different calc 147 class with a different teacher. RIGHT NOW.  Trust me and everyone else on here who has taken this class. Gave me multiple zero's on test problems for not doing the question 'his way' even thought the answer was correct. "
"Mr. Farm knows math and he wants you to learn.  Don't expect him to just give you the answers. He will answer any and every question and clarify anything you need.  Attend class, do the assignments and you'll do fine.  Gives 2 tests (10 questions each) and final (15 questions). Super nice, nerdy guy who's motto is 'Math on!' "
"Terrible at teaching, absolutely no help when asking questions, and was rude to his own students."
"Mr. Farm is in the top 3 of the worst teachers I have ever had. He assigns work that you did not cover on web assign (the worst way to do math homework). He is not very helpful, and is very odd. Avoid this professor at all costs, he will make an easy subject hard to comprehend."
"Like others have said, he seems like a great guy, and is very willing to help his students.  That said, he spends most of every lecture period answering questions from current or previous assignments and then only lectures on new material for 10 min.  So I basically have had to teach myself the material which makes it super tough and time consuming"
"Is a very nice teacher, but hard to understand his lectures. He expects you to know too much coming into the class, and goes far over the students head's while lecturing. WebAssign assignments are long and hard as he doesn't go over any of it in class. Lots of out of class homework. "
"Seems like a nice guy, but he expects you to know calculus coming into the class and doesn't give much for notes. "
"Annoying, not helpful. Incredibly unclear."
  He tries his best to make sure everyone gets the help they need.  He tries to make lecture fun. He gives a lot of homework but will extend deadline to the amount of time you need to get done.  He is a good guy.
